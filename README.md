# Data Visualization With MatplotLib
Having had to present my findings to different colleagues in short yet neat presentations that contain an overview of all the data and insights obtained from it,  I did this project as part of [DataCamp](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-data-visualization-with-matplotlib) to improve my visualization skills for my thesis.
These exercises clearly explain the basics of matplotib to visualize data. 

### Chapter 1
Contains an introduction to creating figures, line plots and customizing the plots using markers, linestyles and colours. 

### Chapter 2 
Contains visualizations of time series data. 

### Chapter 3
Contains visualizations using bar plots, box plots, scatter plots, histograms. 

### Chapter 4
Contains code on how to change the visualization style :for example using the syle of `ggplot` from `R` and changing the aspect ratio using figure size. 
It also includes the options available to save an image with different formats depending on the intended use (presentation, website, printing).
